## Customize the bot:

## Deploy It Online:

Online Hosting Services:
Here are some hosting services I would recommend to use:

- [Railway.app](https://railway.app) - A free hosting which offers 24/7 uptime, fast network speeds, and more!
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - Also a free hosting but with only 550 hours per month without a cc, and bot will sleep after some time of inactivity.
- [Koyeb](https://koyeb.com) - A free hosting service with 24/7 uptime, and kinda same like Railway.app
